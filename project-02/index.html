                <h2 class="body-text" style="color:#4C5E4F">I will admit that I have a caffeine addiction... and I probably drink much more coffee than a human should probably drink in a day ☕. I actually used to drink iced almond lattes, but I learned how

I love going on drives with my friends, whether it be with or without a destination in mind! Music is absolutely a must. My favorite drive is Skyline; it is so beautiful, there are many trees, and honestly just a fun drive overall.</h2>

I started watching Grey's during quarantine last March, and I finished all 16 seasons at the time within two months. An absolute gem of a show + also Patrick Dempsey 😊</h2>
