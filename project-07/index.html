    <h1>Albums I Would Sell My Left Kidney For</h1>
    
    <p>These are the albums that I would literally sell my left kidney for and also probably commit a felony. If you are ever searching for something to listen to, you cannot go wrong with any of these albums. Absolutely 10/10. Genuinely not a single bad song on any of these albums.</p>
