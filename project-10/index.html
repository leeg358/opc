    <h3>Let's Chill is a website designed to provide the user with a curated list of music to listen to depending on the time of the day and user. The user has the option to select the time of day and the weather. The background of the page also changes to fit with the mood, and the snippets of the songs can also be played on the website via an embedded Spotify iframe. The data for the website was pulled from an Airtable database that was created by Rachel Lee. </h3>

    <h3>There was a lot of change throughout the process of this project. My initial Figma sketches lookeed incredibly different from my final site. Initially, I was envisioning something that was more friendly and speaking directly to the user.</h3>
